Olivier secretly rescues Scar so that he can assist Miles in rebuilding Ishbal. Having previously seen off Lin, who had promised to take care of May's clan among others once he becomes emperor, Ed and Al return to Risembool where an overjoyed Winry awaits them. Two years later, Grumman, who had become Fuhrer, visits Bradley's wife, who had been raising up Selim to be a compassionate child. Al decides to travel with Jerso and Zampano to Xing and other eastern countries to learn about alkahestry, whilst Ed learns what he can in the west, hoping to pool their research together. As Ed heads off, he and Winry finally express their love to each other using confusing terminology.",

To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways.\n\nThe Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.",
