# Awesome Project Build with TypeORM

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. Run `npm start` command

This is a small API about movies and series with authentication and authorization(JWT and Passport).
We used typeORM for the database manipulation and NestJS on the server.
